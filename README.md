📊 Key Findings & Business Insights
Primary Churn Drivers
	1	Contract Type: Month-to-month customers 3x more likely to churn
	2	Customer Tenure: 65% of churns occur within first 12 months
	3	Payment Method: Electronic check users show 40% higher churn
	4	Service Adoption: Low service usage correlates with 2.3x churn rate
Strategic Recommendations
	•	Immediate: Deploy predictive alerts for customers >70% churn probability
	•	Short-term: Launch targeted retention campaigns by customer segment
	•	Long-term: Redesign onboarding process for new customer retention
